\section{Tainted types to the rescue}

\Red{
Notes - Wrap data from the sandbox. But this is not all! Tainted types 
must make an effort to permit some benign operations, automate security 
checks. Else this is not simplified the problem in any way. In fact the 
goal is to push off security checks to as late as possible --- this is 
what actually simplifies the security checks.

Tainted types also provide an avenue to address some orthogonal 
practical challenges, namely ABI differences and incremental porting.

--------

Perhaps formulate this section as a series of design patterns 

Design pattern 1: Wrap untrusted data

Design pattern 2: Allow benign operations. Tainted computations.

Design pattern 3: Automate common security checks.

Design pattern 4: Provide a null sandbox. Key to incremental porting 
and downstream sandboxing.
