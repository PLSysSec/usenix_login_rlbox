# Introduction

Modern software makes heavy use of third-party libraries. While this key for
developer productivity, this is also a security nightmare. Third party
libraries, today, are completely trusted and, unfortunately, this means that
bugs in any library can be easily exploited to compromise the entire
application. Even more worrisome, attacks on software supply chains are
becoming more prevealent: attackers are compromising (and sometimes buying)
the accounts of software maintainers to slip backdoored code into popular
libraries.

However, there is a practical alternative. Many libraries do not require
complete trust for applications to safely use their functionality. For
example, image decoders like libjpeg and libpng don't need access to
anything but the image buffers they operates on, OpenSSL doesn't need access
to anything but the socket it's reading from and the bytstream it's writing
the decrypted HTTP stream to, and spell checkers like Hunspell don't need
access to anything but dictionary files and the string it's spell checking.
These are just a few examples, however, we believe many other examples
abound.

Unfortunately, library sandboxing has suffered from a chicken and egg
problem. Without practical tools for sandboxing libraries with minimal
performance overhead and engineering effort, developers and security
engineers are not looking for these opportunities. Our own experience,
with sandboxing libraries in Firefox reflects this. Our initial
attempts to manually sandbox third party libraries were labor intensive,
and extremely error prone. In contrast, once we developed a mature
framwork---RLBox---to support this activity, the incremental work to sandbox
new libraries became minimal, and more opportunities to sandbox additional
parts of the application became apparent.

For example, while we began with third party font shaping libraries, now
Firefox developers and security engineers are using RLBox for media decoding,
spell checking, even speech synthesis. Similar opportunities exist in any
other application domains, like secure messaging apps (e.g., Signal,
WhatsApp, and iMessage) and enterprise tools (e.g., Zoom, Slack, and VS
Code), where developers use third party libraries for media rendering, and
various functionality like spell checking and autocomplete.

In the rest of this article we will lay out the path to making library
sandboxing a goto tool in more software engineering environments. We start
with how RLbox works and how it leverages the C++ type systems to make
sandboxing practical. Then we outline what we need to do to bring sandboxingg
to other langauges. Finally, we end with a vision of what software
development could look like if we have first-class support for sandboxing.

# RLbox framework

# Sandboxing for everyone: what we need and why.



What do we need to make this possible. Need sufficient language support--
meta-programming or DSL and need standardized framework that uses this stuff.


Similar opportunities exist in any any messaging (e.g. signal, telegram,
whatsapp) or social media application (facebook, instagram), will rely on a
similar collection of third party libraries for media rendering, as well as
functionality like spell checking and autocomplete.

Once the sandboxing hammer widely available, developers will start looking
for other nails.

In the rest of this article we will lay out the path to making library sandboxing
a goto tool in more software engineering environments. 

How RLbox works, and how it leverages the C++ type systems.
What we need to do this in other languages.

How this could change the way we develop software.
    -designing with sandboxing at start (trusted core, less trusted periphery)
    -package ecosystems with sandboxing built in (wasm ecosystem example)








\paragraph{Why now?}
While this is not a novel idea, and similar concepts have been bandied about
for years in reseearch we believe this is increasingly practical. Trends
in compiler toolchains and processors architectures make efficient in-process
isolation increasingly practical without resorting to exotic techniques e.g.
WebAssembly is becoming a defacto standard tool chain for software based
fault isolation, multi-core and even minion processors support the
use of multiple protection domains without prohibitive overheads, and
emerging architecture features such as Intel MPK and ARM-Cheri allow
in-process isolation with very low overhead.

Next, as our own work on Firefox in collabortation with colleuages at Mozilla
has illustrated, the software engineering problems of sandboxing, including
efficienty porting libraries into a sandboxed environment, and ensuring that
interactions between the sandboxed library and trusted application can be
secured without expert knowledge, are practical.


\paragraph{Sandboxing in Firefox: Third Party code and Beyond}

The Firefox renderer, like that of every other browser has until recently
been built as a trusted monolith, with all modules and third party libraries
being totally trusted. As a consequence a vulnerability e.g. a memory safety
bug, in any one of these compromises the entire renderer i.e. the entire web
application being rendered.

In collaboration with colleauges at Mozilla, we have been moving Firefox away
from this model, and towards a model where third party libraries e.g., image,
audio, and video decoders, as well as other modules e.g. the spell checker
are run in isolated sandboxes. This effectively partitions the renderer into
two parts, a more trusted core, and a less trusted periphery consisting of
many modules who simply donâ€™t need the same level of privilege, nor to live
in the same address space as the the trusted core.

We believe this approach has relevance far beyond Firefox, and that many
modern applications can benefit from a similar approach.

Obvious first examples include mobile applications whose structure in simple
ways mirrors that of the renderer. For example, any messaging (e.g. signal,
telegram, whatsapp) or social media application (facebook, instagram), will
rely on a similar collection of third party libraries for media rendering, as
well as functionality like spell checking and autocomplete.

However, we believe additional examples will abound if more developers embrace this pattern. 

In modern applications all code is trusted by default.  This makes them excessively fragile,
especially as a large fraction of this code consists of third-party dependencies, written by different developers, of different trustworthiness. Security vulnerabilities in dependencies today often manifest as security vulnerabilities in the application using the dependencies.

This also creates a tension between developer productivity and security, since as new features are added to an application, the trusted computing base grows larger. Inevitably the need for greater functionality and productivity trumps 

This is a dumb way to build modern software, because it makes application unnecessarily fragile


 An enormous amount of software
is written in C/C++, including the native code underlying many modules in ``safe''
languages such as Python. In these settings a vulnerability in any part
of the application, or its libraries often compromises the entire application.


Code bases evolve.
We have come to view this tension between security and functionality or even
productivity, and this is not fundamental, its an artifact of monolithic
application architectures. <Example showing how functionality can be
added without diminishing security>

Why your code should be sandboxed.

-because third party libraries
-because code quality varies e.g., outsource, legacy code, blah. and
 shouldn't be security critical.
-because securing code is difficult/to impossible, slows down feature
velocity, and is expensive, and lots of people just don't do it.

\section{Why now is the time for more sandboxing?}



\section{Secure Sandboxing for Everyone}
-existing approaches coarse grain/manaul
-security is hard blah (some code examples from rlbox paper section 3?)
-porting is hard blah (want to minimize changes to libraries and application)
-leverage C++ types/compiler/etc. support to make this usable.

\section{The beautiful future}
-common framwork for sandboxing as part of language ecosystem
-other languages?
