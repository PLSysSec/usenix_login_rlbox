\section{Improving and expanding the use of tainted types}

\Red{Notes - this supports integrating the hardware capabilities pattern, 
supports hardware transactional memory with tainted volatile,  
integrating with interface types (like typescript library for interfaces but 
with contracts), this can be apply to all user input apis in a lang std library 
such as scanf, getline etc ---This would certainly put some types of user 
validation bugs in more sharp focus - sql injection, path traversal bugs, regex 
DOS attacks. Languages and libraries could also safely provide APIs that 
consume tainted data in place of requiring validators --- a tainted regex 
should be processed by the poly time algorithm, rather than one with an 
exponential worst case
