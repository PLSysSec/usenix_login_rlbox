\section{Improving and expanding the use of tainted types}

\Red{Notes - this supports integrating the hardware capabilities pattern, 
integrating with interface types (like typescript library for interfaces but 
with contracts), this can be apply to all user input apis in a lang std library 
such as scanf, getline etc ---This would certainly put some types of user 
validation bugs in more sharp focus - sql injection, path traversal bugs, regex 
DOS attacks. Languages and libraries could also safely provide APIs that 
consume tainted data in place of requiring validators --- a tainted regex 
should be processed by the poly time algorithm, rather than one with an 
exponential worst case
